# Git Learning Sandbox

This repository serves as a personal playground for learning and practicing Git version control fundamentals.

## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to experiment with various Git commands and workflows in a safe environment.

## Concepts Covered
This repository is used to practice the following Git operations:
- **Branching**: Creating, switching, and merging branches (e.g., `dev_branch`).
- **Commits**: Making changes and recording snapshots of the project history.
- **Staging**: Using `git add` to prepare files for commit.
- **Undoing Changes**: Experimenting with resets, reverts, and checkout to undo modifications.

## Repository Structure
- `dev_branch_file.txt`: A text file created specifically to test branching workflows.
- `Second_File.txt`: A general file used for practicing basic add/commit cycles.
